# The Weather App

This is the simple weather app made with React. I made this because I wanted to learn how to inegrate external API in my app.

The user just have to enter the city name to see weather.

I used **Open Weather Map** to generate new API and integrate into my app. Many thanks to them. I recommend you to do the same. Head over to [Open Weather Map](openweathermap.org) to generate your own API key.

_Remember to keep your API key secure and private and follow best practices to do it._

## Steps to run this app:
This app is not yet live. Therefore, I you want to see how this app looks or works, you will have to follow these steps. Ensure you have Node.js installed and your API key is generated and stored in `.env` file in your root directory:

1. Clone this repo in your machine:

    `git clone https://github.com/sandeshpd/weather-app.git`

2. Open root folder:

    `cd weather-app`

3. You have to install all dependecies according to specifications in `package.json`:

    `npm install`

4. And just enter the command to run the app:

    `npm run dev`

5. Copy the `http://localhost/5173` local server address in the browser search bar.

## Issues:
If you ran into any issues, I'm always open to discuss them and solve them as I love to keep learning new things. Please open issues on [Issues](https://github.com/sandeshpd/weather-app/issues) tab.
